##The Problem

Distributed digitial governance solutions have an identity problem. Specifically, it is difficult to design a system that ensures that people cannot dominate a system by controlling resources.

For example, to enable the application of digital democracy, in which each person gets one vote, how can a distributed, digital system ensure that one person isn't controlling multiple accounts in order to game the system?

This has also been referred to as the one person, one wallet problem in the cryptocurrency space.
