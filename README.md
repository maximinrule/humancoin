#HumanCoin

##The Problem

Distributed digitial governance solutions have an identity problem. Specifically, it is difficult to design a system that ensures that people cannot dominate a system by controlling resources.

For example, to enable the application of digital democracy, in which each person gets one vote, how can a distributed, digital system ensure that one person isn't controlling multiple accounts in order to game the system?

This has also been referred to as the one person, one wallet problem in the cryptocurrency space.

##The Solution
Some solutions have been proposed. Examples include using social networks and reputation, or using the game Go as a test to prove humanity.

Fortunately, Alan Turing has already designed a test to determine humanity. The [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) asks a human to judge whether they are speaking with a machine or a human.

This document proposes expanding on this test as a way to positively identify humans in the following way:

- at the same time(s) every day, users that wish to recieve HumanCoin log into a system that will connect them randomly with some number (possibly 3) of other users via video conference. 
- They will all communicate with eachother for some amount of time (possibly 5-10 minutes). 
- At the end of their conversation they will vote on whether each of the participants is Human.
- A system reviews the votes and distributes HumanCoin accordingly.
